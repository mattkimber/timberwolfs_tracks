Timberwolf's Tracks
===================

A 2x zoom track set based on British railways, featuring multiple rail 
types. Intended for use with Timberwolf's UK Trains, but can be used 
with most sets that follow a standard railtype scheme.

Features
--------

* 2x zoom and 32bpp graphics compatible with original and OpenGFX style.
* Level crossings and fences update according to year.
* Depot graphics reflect build year.
* Multiple signal types for block/pre/post/combo/path signals
* Unobtrusive catenary wiring
* Overhead, third and fourth rail electric systems (with compatible
  train sets)
* Standard gauge, narrow gauge and plateway (with compatible train
  sets)
* Single and double yellow aspects for JGRPP realistic braking

Gameplay Notes
--------------

Track types feature balanced build and running costs.

- Unpowered standard gauge rail has average build and maintenance 
  costs.
- Plateway and narrow gauge rail are cheap to build and maintain, 
  but limited in speed and (depending on train set) vehicle selection.
- Fourth rail metro track is slightly more expensive than standard 
  gauge rail, but far cheaper than other electrified types.
- Electrified track is expensive to build and maintain. 750V DC third 
  rail is cheaper than 25kV overhead AC, but (depending on train set) 
  typically has slower and less powerful trains available.
- Dual power track allows both 750V DC and 25kV AC locomotives to run, 
  but is extremely expensive to build and maintain, so must be used
  sparingly.
- 630V DC Rail track is a lower speed, lower cost track for metro
  services. Third rail trains can also run on this track type, although
  at a restricted top speed.
- Metro Dual power track allows 630V metro trains, 750V third rail trains
  and 25kV AC locomotives to be powered on the same track. It has a
  restrictive top speed and prohibitively expensive build and maintenance
  costs, so should be used sparingly only for critical routes in
  constricted spaces.
